# cdk-vscode-server

Running your dev IDE vscode on AWS for development and workshop purposes.

## Features

- ‚ö° **Quick Setup**: Spin up and configure your [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) server in under 10 minutes in your AWS account
- üìè **Best Practice Setup**: Set up with [projen](https://projen.io/) and a [single configuration file](./.projenrc.ts) to keep your changes centralized.
- ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Pre-installed packages**: Besides the [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) server, other tools and software packages such as `git`, `docker`, `awscli` `nodejs` and `python` are pre-installed on the EC2 instance.
- üèóÔ∏è **Extensibility**: Pass in properties to the construct, which start with `additional*`. They allow you to extend the configuration to your needs. There are more to come...

## Usage
The following steps get you started:

1. Create a new `awscdk-app` via
```bash
npx projen new awscdk-app-ts --package-manager=npm
```
3. Add `@mavogel/cdk-vscode-server` as a dependency to your project in the `.projenrc.ts` file
4. Run `yarn run projen` to install it
5. Add the following to the `src/main.ts` file:
```ts
import { App, Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as iam from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { 
  LinuxArchitectureType, 
  LinuxFlavorType, 
  VSCodeServer
} from '@mavogel/cdk-vscode-server';

export class MyStack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps = {}) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new VSCodeServer(this, 'vscode', {
      // for example (or simply use the defaults by not setting the properties)
      instanceVolumeSize: 8,
      instanceClass: ec2.InstanceClass.M7G,
      instanceSize: ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE,
      instanceOperatingSystem: LinuxFlavorType.UBUNTU_22,
      instanceCpuArchitecture: LinuxArchitectureType.ARM,
      
      // üëáüèΩ or if you want to give the InstanceRole more permissions
      additionalInstanceRolePolicies: [
        new iam.PolicyStatement({
          effect: iam.Effect.ALLOW,
          actions: [
            'codebuild:*',
          ],
          resources: [
            `arn:aws:codebuild:*:${Stack.of(this).account}:*/*`,
          ],
        }),
      ]
      
      // and more... üí°
    });
  }
}

const env = {
  account: '123456789912',
  region: 'eu-central-1',
};

const app = new App();
new MyStack(app, 'vscode-server', { env });
app.synth();
```

and deploy it
```bash
npx projen build
npx projen deploy
```

with the output
```console
‚ú®  Deployment time: 509.87s

Outputs:
dev.vscodedomainName6729AA39 = https://d1foo65bar4baz.cloudfront.net/?folder=/Workshop
dev.vscodepassword64FBCA12 = foobarbaz
```

> [!Important]
> There are issues with copy pasting into the VSCode terminal within the Firefox browser (2025-01-12)

Then open the domain name in your favorite browser and you'd see the following login screen:

After entering the password, you are logged into VSCode and can start coding :tada:

## Inspiration
This project was created based on the following inspiration

- [vscode-on-ec2-for-prototyping](https://github.com/aws-samples/vscode-on-ec2-for-prototyping): as baseline, which unfortunately was outdated
- [aws-terraform-dev-container](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-terraform-dev-container): as baseline for terraform, but unfortunately also outdated
- [java-on-aws-workshop-ide-only.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/java-on-aws/blob/main/labs/unicorn-store/infrastructure/cfn/java-on-aws-workshop-ide-only.yaml): an already synthesized cloudformation stack, which used mostly python as the custom resources
- [fleet-workshop-team-stack-self.json](https://static.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/public/cc4aa67e-5b7a-4df1-abf7-c42502899a25/assets/fleet-workshop-team-stack-self.json): also an already synthesized cloudformation stack, which did much more as I currently implemented here. 
- [eks-workshop-vscode-cfn.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/eks-workshop-v2/blob/main/lab/cfn/eks-workshop-vscode-cfn.yaml): another great baseline
